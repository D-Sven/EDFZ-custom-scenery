# EDFZ-custom-scenery
Mainz Finthen is a rather busy airfield located in south-western Germany. 

08/26: Departing and landing runway for motorised planes.
08R/26L grass: Used for glider operations and UL-practice (UltraLight).
Traffic patterns are flown south of the airport. Means:
        From 08: Left turns
        From 26: Right turns
        Altitude: 1500ft - max. 3000ft MSL
Airspace C borders at 3500ft MSL, be sure to not enter it. ~2 nm to the east of the field,
airspace D begins (1500ft - GND) and a C (1500ft-FL100). Try to stay out of there unless you obtain a clearance from DFS.
(which FG pilots usually have, don't we ? :D)

This custom scenery contains: 
            a complete new groundnet of the field
            shared models and the original tower building and hangars
            multiple parking positions
            osm-2-city-buildings for the city of Mainz (Installation described below)
            coming up soon: a fgfp and procedure for traffic pattern and to nearby airports
            

INSTALLATION: Add the folder /EDFZ-custom-scenery/osm2city/ and /EDFZ-custom-scenery to your FG_SCENERY (very first page of FG-Wizard launcher) 
or add the following when starting FG via commandline:

 --fg-scenery=/YOUR_SCENERY_PATH/EDFZ-custom-scenery/osm2city /YOUR_SCENERY_PATH/EDFZ-custom-scenery
                                        =                                       =
                           osm2city buildings (NOTICE)                  Mainz Finthen Airport
YOUR_SCENERY_PATH can just be a random directory where you extracted the downloaded scenery!

NOTICE: osm2city may decrease framerate... If this is the case, remove the /osm2city folder from FG_SCENERY (prefered) or delete it.
