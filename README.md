# EDFZ-custom-scenery
EDFZ is one of the biggest and busiest airfields in south-western Germany for VFR flights, soaring, helis and educational purposes. It has two parallel runways. The southern runway is used for Ultralight-planes and gliders, the asphalt runway for everything else (Cessnas, Gyros and private jets). Here is a authentic custom scenery for it! Have fun :)


This custom scenery contains a complete new groundnet of taxiways because what you see in terrasync is only this standard airport with one taxiway down the runway.
Thanks to d-laser for making this possible.

Also, i tried to place some shared models from https://scenery.flightgear.org/download.php  to make the airport looking as real as it gets.
Some things are different than in reality, but the structure is the same...
