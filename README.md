# EDFZ-custom-scenery
EDFZ is one of the biggest and busiest airfields in south-western Germany for VFR flights, soaring, helis and educational purposes. It has two parallel runways. The southern runway is used for Ultralight-planes and gliders, the asphalt runway for everything else (Cessnas, Gyros and private jets). Here is a authentic custom scenery for it! Have fun :)
